## Technical Architecture

### Core Technology Stack
```
Frontend Framework: React Native with Expo Router
Language: TypeScript/JavaScript
UI Framework: React Native Components
Styling: StyleSheet API with Linear Gradients
Navigation: Expo Router (File-based routing)
State Management: React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
Platform: Cross-platform (Web, iOS, Android)
```

I built this application using React Native with Expo Router, specifically leveraging:

Expo SDK 52.0.30 and Expo Router 4.0.17 for the foundation

TypeScript for type safety and better development experience

React Native for cross-platform compatibility (web, iOS, Android)

JavaScript/TypeScript as the primary programming languages

**Project Structure and File Organization**

I organized the project following Expo Router's file-based routing system:
